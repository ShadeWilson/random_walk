# random_walk

A random walk simulation where the direction is chosen at random using runif(). An optional time argument that must be an integer
can be supplied for the desired number of steps. The default is 10,000, but fewer steps will also work and wil run faster. The
random_walk() function returns a plot of the change in position over time.
